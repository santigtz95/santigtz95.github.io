**(Important Notes:**
<ul>
  <li>2% Referral Fee - Share, Share, Share !</li>
  <li>If an anchor tenant (like CVS, Walgreens, etc.) signs a long-term lease, then we would develop the corner lot for said anchor tenant - not sell – because it increases returns by about 25%; however, if obtaining said anchor tenant is unsuccessful within the Phase 1 timeframe, then we simply move onto Phase 2 and wait for an anchor tenant or sell the corner lot.</li>
  <li>If we sell the 1.77-acre corner lot, we would have acquired the remaining 5 acres for about $9.50 per square foot, which is a gift for that part of town (less than 2/3 of market value).</li>
  <li>Along with other major brand names, Buc-ee’s convenience store/gas station is expected to open its doors in 2025 at the corner of Main St. and IH-10 ... the “Boerne Bypass” is the place to be right now.</li>
</ul>
